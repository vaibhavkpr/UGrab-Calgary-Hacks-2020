Find personalized food options around campus faster with UGrab
Calgary Hacks 2020 Group Entry

# Inspiration
We wanted to create an application to easily find food around campus. With many different ways to sort, it makes it easy to find the food you want.

# What it does
It takes in many user inputs and give the user a list of all the food items from around the campus. From budget limitations to food types, dietary restrictions and restaurants, Ugrab has the right options for you!

# How we built it
It was built in JavaFX.

# Challenges we ran into
The amount of time given was a big constraint. Also everyone did not know Java. All the features we wanted to add we did not get around.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The overall design of the application protoype was a point that we were really proud of and the UI really focuses on minimalism along with ease of access that's not only tailored for university students but anyone who wants to grab food at campus. The experience of working in a fast paced team environment and bringing a concept to life was invaluable.
